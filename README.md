## About The Project

As far as I can tell, nobody has written a "Multibox" for Growtopia in Python. Currently still working on it as of 15/06/2022

Features (not a lot of them):

* Open multiple instances of Growtopia.
* No bans.
* Close all opened instances of Growtopia with a single line.



## Getting Started

To run the multibox follow the steps:

### Prerequisites

Python 3, Unmodified Growtopia exectuable, Admin rights.

### Installation

1. Get python 3 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ .

2. Copy the code or download the .py file.

3. Create a new .py file/unzip the downloaded file.


## Usage

Run the .py file as admin through cmd:
(Replace admin with current user name)

```sh
C:\>python3 C:\Users\admin\Desktop\MultiBox_Work_In_Progress.py
```
